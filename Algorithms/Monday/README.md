Remove Blanks:

Create a function that, given a string, returns all of the string's contents, but without blanks.

'Pl ayTha tF   unkyM usi     c  ' would return 'PlayThatFunkyMusic'

Get Digits:

Create a function that given a string, returns the integer made from this string's digits.

"0s1z3y5w7h9a2t4?6!8?0" would return "01357924680"

Remove Shorter Strings

Given a string array and value(length), remove any strings shorter than the length from the array

["Today", "is", "Monday", "the", "first", "day", "of", "the", "week"] with a length of 4, would return ["Today", "Monday", "first", "week"]
